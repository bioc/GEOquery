Description: The NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) is a public repository of
             microarray data (>130,000 experiments).  Given the rich
             and varied nature of these data, it is only natural to
             want to apply BioConductor tools to these data.  GEOquery
             is the bridge between GEO and BioConductor.
